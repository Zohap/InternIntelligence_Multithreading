This project is a multithreaded task scheduler implemented in C++ that executes tasks based on their priority levels. Tasks with a lower priority number (starting from 1 as the highest priority) are executed first. It uses a thread-safe priority queue to manage task ordering and a pool of worker threads to process tasks concurrently. Synchronization between threads is handled using `std::mutex` and `std::condition_variable` to ensure thread safety, especially when accessing or modifying the shared task queue.

The scheduler supports clean shutdowns, allowing all running threads to finish executing before the program terminates. To provide clear and non-overlapping console output in a multithreaded environment, all `std::cout` statements are wrapped with a mutex, ensuring one thread prints at a time. This makes the output easy to read and accurately reflects the order and thread responsible for each task.

This project was developed using standard C++17 libraries and is cross-platform compatible. It serves as a great introduction to multithreaded programming concepts such as thread lifecycle management, safe resource access, race condition prevention, and condition-based synchronization. The scheduler is suitable for students and professionals who want to understand how to implement concurrent systems or build a basic task processing framework in C++.
